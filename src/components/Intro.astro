    Welcome<br /> to ESLAND awards
  </h1>

  <p>
    Film has the Oscars, music has the Grammys, and <strong>
      streaming has the ESLAND Awards</strong
    >. Awards that celebrate the creativity and talent of the best content
    creators in <strong>the Spanish-speaking community</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spain, Latin America, and Andorra united by creators, both male and female,
    and their communities, to remember and relive <strong
      >some of the best moments of the year</strong
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    After two celebrated events, one at the Palau de la MÃºsica Catalana in
    Barcelona, and another at the National Auditorium in Mexico City, we can
    only look forward to <strong>the third edition in Andorra</strong>.
